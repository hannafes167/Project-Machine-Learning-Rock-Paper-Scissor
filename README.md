Project Steps:

Data Collection:
Gather images of hands showing Rock, Paper, and Scissors gestures.
Split the dataset into training and validation.

Data Preprocessing:
Perform data augmentation to increase the variety in the dataset.

Model Building and Training:
Use TensorFlow to build a neural network model.
Train the model using the preprocessed dataset.
Apply techniques like dropout and learning rate to enhance model performance.
Use GPU in colab so make running model faster.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance using validation.
Calculate metrics such as loss and accuracy to assess model performance.
Model performance by training loss : 0.0809, validation loss : 0.0610, accuracy train : 0.9817, and accuracy validation : 0.09851 

Prediction and Application:
Use the trained model to make predictions on new images.
Develop a simple application to demonstrate real-time model predictions.

Expected Outcomes:
A model that can classify hand gesture images with high accuracy.
Improved understanding of the process of developing an image classification model using TensorFlow.
Practical experience in data collection, preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.
